If you asked me to design an application like YouTube in a systems design interview, I'd approach it with a structured breakdown, focusing on core functionalities, scalability, and key considerations:

**1. Requirements Gathering and Scope Definition:**

* **Clarify the scope:**  I'd start by understanding the specific features we're focusing on. Is it just video uploading, playback, and searching? Or should we also consider features like live streaming, comments, recommendations, and monetization?
* **Identify key metrics:**  I'd ask about expected traffic, video upload volumes, and storage needs to get an idea of the scale we're designing for.

**2. High-Level System Design:**

* **Components:** I'd outline the main components like:
    * **Video Storage:** Distributed file system (like HDFS) or object storage (like S3) for storing large video files.
    * **Metadata Database:** To store video metadata (title, description, tags, etc.), user information, and other structured data.
    * **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** To distribute video content globally for fast and efficient delivery to users.
    * **Video Processing Pipeline:** To handle video transcoding into different formats and resolutions.
    * **Search Index:** To enable efficient search functionality.
    * **Recommendation Engine:**  (Optional) To personalize video recommendations for users.
    * **Load Balancers:** To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

* **Data Flow:** I'd describe how a video is uploaded, processed, stored, and delivered to users.

**3. Deep Dive into Components:**

* **Video Storage:** Discuss scalability, redundancy, and data durability.
* **Metadata Database:** Choose between relational (like MySQL) or NoSQL (like Cassandra) based on trade-offs.
* **CDN:**  Explain edge caching, content replication, and global load balancing.
* **Video Processing:** Consider asynchronous processing and scaling strategies.
* **Search Index:** Discuss indexing techniques, ranking algorithms, and optimizing for relevance.
* **Recommendation Engine:** (If applicable) Outline potential algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) and data sources.

**4. Scalability and Performance:**

* **Horizontal Scaling:**  Describe how to scale out various components (e.g., adding more servers) to handle increased traffic.
* **Caching:** Identify caching opportunities at different levels (e.g., CDN edge caching, database caching) to improve response times.
* **Database Sharding/Partitioning:** Discuss strategies for handling large datasets.
* **Load Balancing:**  Explain load balancing algorithms and techniques to ensure even traffic distribution.

**5. Key Considerations:**

* **Fault Tolerance:** Discuss strategies to handle server failures and ensure high availability.
* **Consistency:**  Address data consistency challenges across distributed systems.
* **Security:**  Mention measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Monetization:**  (If applicable) Discuss ad serving and other revenue streams.

**Throughout the discussion:**

* I'd actively seek your input and feedback to ensure I'm addressing your priorities and concerns.
* I'd whiteboard or use visual aids to illustrate the system architecture and data flow.
* I'd be open to discussing trade-offs and alternative approaches.

**Remember:** 

* The goal is to demonstrate your ability to think critically, analyze complex systems, and communicate technical ideas effectively. 
* Focus on the core concepts and trade-offs, rather than memorizing specific solutions. 
* Be prepared to adapt your design based on the interviewer's feedback and questions.
